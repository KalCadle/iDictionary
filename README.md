This Siri Shortcut allows the user to replicate most of the functionality of the Dicitonary app on macOS.  The iDictionary shortcut provides a simple user interface for inputing a word to look up, and the shortcut returns the results from the iPadOS system dictionary.  The shortcut can be pinned to the Home Screen, The Control Center, or can be added to the Share Sheet.
